Passera
=======

Passera is a Scala library that provides some utilities for scientific
computing.

- UInt - unsigned ints
- ULong - unsigned longs
- BBArray - buffer-backed arrays
- VeryLargeArray - long-index arrays

This is still very much a work in progress.  
Much of it was written a while ago as an exercise in learning Scala.

TODO: add support for value classes.
